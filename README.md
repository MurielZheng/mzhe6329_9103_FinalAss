#### Pacita Abad (1946-2004) was a Filipino painter known for her colorful, vivid, and multi-layered works. In her works, you can see the fusion of various art forms and techniques, such as painting, printing and dyeing, sewing, etc. Abad's works often have a strong visual impact, with bright colors and diverse forms, intertwined with her in-depth reflections on society, culture and personal experiences.
#### "Wheels of Fortune" is a work by Pacita Abad. This work shows Abad's typical style: bright colors and complex geometric shapes. From this painting, we can see circles of various sizes, shapes and colors intertwined and influencing each other, as if the wheel of fate is constantly turning, representing the highs and lows, opportunities and challenges in life. In "Wheels of Fortune," Abad uses the overlap, size, and color variations of circles to express the complexity and diversity of life. Each circle can be seen as an individual's destiny. They are interconnected and influence each other, forming an intricate network of destiny. Every point, line and shape in the picture is full of vitality, as if to tell us: life is colorful and full of variables, and we should cherish every moment and face the future bravely. "Wheels of Fortune" is a work full of energy, color and meaning that perfectly demonstrates Pacita Abad's unique understanding of life, destiny and art.

#### Aboriginal art: The circular patterns are similar to stippling techniques commonly found in Aboriginal art, particularly Australian Aboriginal art. From the centre of each circle, radiating colours and patterns can be associated with Dreamtime stories in Aboriginal art, where each pattern may represent a story or geographical feature.
#### Modern digital art: The choice of colours and the design layout is perhaps influenced by modern digital art, which can be found on various design websites. Specifically, using gradients and contrasting colours for each circle may have been inspired by certain websites or digital artworks.

Audio Visualization
FFT Analysis: The use of the p5.FFT() object for analysing the frequency spectrum of the audio signal is based on the p5.js sound library's FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) documentation.
Audio Input: Capturing live audio input through the p5.AudioIn() object is implemented by following the p5.AudioIn documentation.
Visual Elements
Color Palette: Using a predefined colour palette for visual elements was inspired by aesthetic considerations discussed in Kuler's color theory guide.
